Things still needed to go over:
A collision callback so our laser can knock over objects, this allows linear velocity to be taught at the same time. The next example we could rebuild with constructioninfo, create a ramp and show how friction works.
We need to fix the math for the laser sight, although the raycast seems to be fine so it is unknown if the math is actually incorrect
